Correlation between the different variables and then i used seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the correlation later on.

- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

- Found missing data and assigned appropriate values to it
- Removed the duplicate data
- Changed Data typed of some columns to use them in the correlation
